# Dependencies

We have two primary dependencies:

- `com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.2.0`
- `com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-jackson:2.2.0`

Using a different version of `retrofit2` in your project should typically not cause any issues. You should be able to use `retrofit` (version 1) in your own projects as well as this library at the same time without causing any issues.
